			<p>NCPCC 2016 Mumbai, The Pediatric Critical Care 
				Conference with a Difference, the theme being 
				“Less Invasive……. More Intensive “.
				It is an all-inclusive conference, addressing the 
				issues that are approaching the frontiers of science 
				and ideas that have moved from bench to bedside. 
				It aims to fine tune the day to day practices 
				including fluid therapy, inotropes, antimicrobial 
				use, ventilation strategies, RRT  in the background 
				of recent guidelines and landmark  publications 
				that you may not have had the time to read.</p>
				<p style="padding-top: 2% !important;">Unique features of this conference include, a 
					special full day track dedicated to reaching out 
					to the difficult-to-reach critically ill child in villages, 
					talukas and districts where 80% of our children live. 
					If you are a pediatrician coping with this difficult 
					task, you must attend to discuss and evolve 
					collective solutions with the most ingenious 
					minds in pediatric critical care.
					</p>
					<p style="padding-top: 2% !important;">
					There are 10 workshops to choose from, each 
					providing an opportunity for hands on learning 
					under the guidance of international faculty and 
					national experts. The Pre-conference CMEs 
					address critical care issues in case-based 
					interactive format (“Chaat sessions”) without 
					didactic lectures.
					</p>
					<p style="padding-top: 2% !important;">
					Most important of all, we plan to provide several 
					platforms for one-to-one interactions between 
					delegates and  experienced faculties for you to 
					ask questions that you may not have asked or 
					got a chance to ask, during the sessions. 
					Welcome to the warmth and vibrancy of Mumbai 
					at a conference without boundaries & barriers.
					</p>
